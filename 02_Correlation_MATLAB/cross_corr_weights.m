%--------------Inputs--------------%
%ch1 - first array of photon arrival times
%ch2 - second array of photon arrival times
%start_time - smallest lag time to be analyzed (the lowest value is 1 time
%   unit)
%stop_time - largest lag time
%coarseness - a number usually between 1 and 10, that determines the number
%   of points in the acf curve for each logarithmic cascade (1-low
%   resolution, 10-high). 

%------------Outputs---------------%
% corr_norm - normalized cross correlation between ch1 and ch2
% lags - log spaced lag times

cascade_start = floor(log2(start_time)-2);% if above 0, the algorithm skips the 2^start_cascade correlation times
[lag_bin_edges, lags, division_factor] = generate_log2_lags(stop_time, coarseness); % generates lags bins with log2 spacing
